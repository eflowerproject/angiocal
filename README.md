#Angiosperm fossil calibrations (AngioCal)

This dataset was automatically generated and exported from PROTEUS v1.27beta12 on 14 August 2019.

This version of our calibration dataset is AngioCal v1.0 (we intend to release updated versions in the future). It includes 238 fossil calibrations for angiosperms compiled for the following paper:
Ramírez-Barahona S, Sauquet H, Magallón S. The delayed and geographically heterogeneous diversification of flowering plants families.

These two files (long PDF and summary spreadsheet) were included as Supplementary Data 2a and Supplementary Data 2b of this paper, respectively. For detailed information on how this dataset was assembled, see the section on Fossil calibration in the Supplementary Methods of this paper. For a mapping of these calibrations on the angiosperm phylogeny, see Supplementary Data 3 (for an overview, see Extended Data Fig. 1).
